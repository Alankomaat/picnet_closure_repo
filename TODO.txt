
- Sould ServerSource really offer a .ajax method for 
  arbitary ajax calls?  Should the ajax calls be generic at all?
- Edit.js needs to use a better MVC style design. And modularisation.

- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
- Creating Complex renderers is ugly as they need the fctx in the contrstructor
  so you are left with code like this:
    var fld = this.createField('ID', cache, { renderer: .... }); 
    fld.spec.renderer = new pn....ComplexRenderer(fld, entity, cache);
- Navigating relationships is very ugly lots of arr map/filter/find everywhere
