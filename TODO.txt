
- Sould ServerSource really offer a .ajax method for 
  arbitary ajax calls?  Should the ajax calls be generic at all?

- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
- Creating Complex renderers is ugly as they need the fctx in the contrstructor
  so you are left with code like this:
    var fld = this.createField('ID', cache, { renderer: .... }); 
    fld.spec.renderer = new pn....ComplexRenderer(fld, entity, cache);
- Navigating relationships is very ugly lots of arr map/filter/find everywhere 
- RelatedTypesCalc creates a spec so that Application can create the spec again
  with the correct cache, this spaghettiness is not right.  Consider adding
  getAdditionalTypes method somewhere else (Static contect perhaps?) and not
  requiring and instance of the spec to create the spec.
