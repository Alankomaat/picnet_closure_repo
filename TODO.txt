- Edit.js and Grid.js need to use a better MVC style design. Same goes for all
  controls.
- Model binding in Edit.js
- Live update models from the server / SignalR

- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
- Make the sync model pluggable (REST / SignalR)

- Remove Grid.EventType, Grid evens should be able to take any events not
    just Grid.EventType.  These just get converted to event-<key> anyways.
    This also applies for Edit.EventType
