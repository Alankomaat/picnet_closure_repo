- AddOnTheFly and other dialogs should dissable the keyboard shortcut 
    listeners when visible.  Best way to do this is to make keyboard
    shortcuts an application wide feature using BaseApp.js
- Edit.js and Grid.js need to use a better MVC style design. Same goes for all
  controls.
- Model binding in Edit.js
- Live update models from the server / SignalR

- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
- Make the sync model pluggable (REST / SignalR)
