- Demos are all broken

- Should try to remove dependency on pn.app.ctx everywhere. 
- Should checkbox field renderers show the required '*' ? makes no sense since 
    they are already checked or unchecked.
- Replace Element|Text|goog.ui.Control everywhere with a typedef
- Remove jquery externs dependency in QuickFind.js
- Use goog.expose to remove the need for the toSlick methods.
- Sould ServerSource really offer a .ajax method for 
  arbitary ajax calls?  Should the ajax calls be generic at all?
- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)

- LocalCache
  * For large lists of a single type LocalCache could be inneficcient, consider using
      buckets for ID ranges to make the update flush operation faster.
  * Handling lots of updates from server is innefficient, we should batch flushes to the
      localStorage.
