- It would be really nice if we could share the ApplicationSettings between 
  client and server given an attribute on the xml node.
- Server side should abstract the JSON/DEJSON of entities, etc
- Why is ID lowercase? Causes issues between server/client as there needs to 
    be conversions at all transfer points
- Move all ui elements to mob/ui or web/ui
- The pn.app.ctx and pn.web.ctx are horrible
- TODO: Proper Mvc see great code: https://raw.github.com/petermichaux/uMVC/master/uMVC.js
- AppEvents needs to have WebAppEvents and MobileAppEvents.  Perhaps since we
  now have BaseApp, BaseMobileApp and BaseWebApp the events should live in
  the same files so we do not have to mantain multiple hierarchies.  There is
  also a parallel hierarchy with AppConfig
- The MultiSpecEdit/LRequestEdit functionality is really convoluted.  Create
    a Tabbed control.

- Should try to remove dependency on pn.app.ctx everywhere. 
- Should checkbox field renderers show the required '*' ? makes no sense since 
    they are already checked or unchecked.
- Replace Element|Text|goog.ui.Control everywhere with a typedef
- Remove jquery externs dependency in QuickFind.js
- Use goog.expose to remove the need for the toSlick methods.
- Sould ServerSource really offer a .ajax method for 
  arbitary ajax calls?  Should the ajax calls be generic at all?
- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
