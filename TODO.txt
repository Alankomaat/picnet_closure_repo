
HI
==
- yesNoRenderers cannot save '0' as bools in data layer are not nullable
- Use Schema to build default controls.
- Refactor Edit.js and the whole FieldBuilders / FieldRenderers mess
- Creater a wrapper for the {value, field, entity, cache} params which are seen
  throughout the application.
- Edit.js and Grid.js need to use a better MVC style design. Same goes for all
  controls.  May need to integrate soy into the picnet closure repo project.
