- Make the clean_and_compile.bat also run on bash
- Edit.js and Grid.js need to use a better MVC style design. Same goes for all

- Creating a UiSpec requires registration in the getUiSpecs method with an
    id but UiSpec constructor also takes an ID, making each UiSpec 
    implementation have to declare the ID twice.
