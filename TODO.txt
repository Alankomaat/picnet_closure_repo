==
- Edit.js and Grid.js need to use a better MVC style design. Same goes for all
  controls.  May need to integrate soy into the picnet closure repo project.  
- Model binding - see Model / View examples Backbone.JS
- Model binding in Edit.js
- Update models from the server
- Make the server run on conventions like Backbone.JS

- Make the clean_and_compile.bat also run on bash
- Creating a UiSpec requires registration in the getUiSpecs method with an
    id but UiSpec constructor also takes an ID, making each UiSpec 
    implementation have to declare the ID twice.
