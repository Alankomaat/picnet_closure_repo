- Demos are all broken

- Should try to remove dependency on pn.app.ctx everywhere.  Ugly. Start with
    LocalCache appVer usage.
- Should checkbox field renderers show the required '*'? makes no sense since 
    they are already checked or unchecked.
- Replace Element|Text|goog.ui.Control everywhere with a typedef
- Remove jquery externs dependency in QuickFind.js
- Use goog.expose to remove the need for the toSlick methods.
- Sould ServerSource really offer a .ajax method for 
  arbitary ajax calls?  Should the ajax calls be generic at all?
- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
