- Demos are all broken
- Tests are all broken

- Use goog.expose to remove the need for the toSlick methods.
- Sould ServerSource really offer a .ajax method for 
  arbitary ajax calls?  Should the ajax calls be generic at all?
- Make the authentication model pluggable (Forms/Windows)
- RelatedTypesCalc creates a spec so that Application can create the spec again
  with the correct cache, this spaghettiness is not right.  Consider adding
  getAdditionalTypes method somewhere else (Static contect perhaps?) and not
  requiring and instance of the spec to create the spec.
